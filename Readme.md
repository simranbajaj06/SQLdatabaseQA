Our system allows users to ask questions in natural language, which are then converted into SQL queries using Google GenerativeAI model and LangChain . This intelligent system executes the queries on the MySQL database to generate accurate responses.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

*Google GenerativeAI LLM*: For natural language processing and query generation.

*LangChain's SQLDatabaseChain*: To integrate the model with the MySQL database.

*Hugging Face Embeddings*: For enhanced semantic understanding.

*Streamlit*: For building a user-friendly interface.

*Chromadb*: As a vector store for efficient data retrieval.

*Few-Shot Learning*: Implemented to fine-tune the model for more precise results.
